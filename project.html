      <h2>RETHINK | REDUCE | REUSE | RECYCLE | REFURBISH </h2>
      <P>There is an increasing focus on waste and resource recovery right now, both locally and globally. The recycling industry has changed. The worldwide recycling market is responding to the end market challenges.  Circular economy focus. Government policy is  moving away from the existing linear model of  take-make-use-dispose.  The circular economy  model aims to keep resources in the system  for as long as possible.
        Waste management is high profile. Our community wants to know what happens to our waste, where it is goes and what they can do to help. We will always generate waste as we live, work and play. To protect our precious resources and to meet the expectations of our community we need to change the way that we as a community understand, create and handle our waste. </P>

      <h1>WHERE WE MUST START</h1>
      <h2>1. BIOMEDICAL WASTE </h2>
      <p>Introduction:

        Biomedical waste is any type of waste either solid or liquid comprising of harmful materials produced by healthcare facilities e.g. hospitals, practices, health camps etc. This waste comprises of human tissues, contaminated blood, body fluids, discarded medicines, drugs, contaminated cotton, dressings, and sharps such as needles, glass, blades, scalpels, lancets. Biomedical waste collection and disposal has highest risk to healthcare, sanitation workers and the general community. The biomedical waste minus appropriate disinfection leads to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), Hepatitis B & C, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), tetanus, psychosocial trauma etc. Biomedical waste management is significant to defend the environment and health of the population.</p>

            <p>Necessity of Biomedical Waste Management:

              Inadequate management of waste produced in health care facilities causes a direct health hazards on the general public, the health care workers and on the environment. There is an obligation for the supervision of biomedical waste to abate the risk of contamination outside the hospital for waste handlers, scavengers and those living in the locality of hospitals. Management is also required due to the risk of air, water, and soil pollution, or due to unsuitable incineration emissions and ash. It plays a vital role in removal of the discarded drugs that can be repacked and traded off.
              
                            <p>Biomedical Waste Management:
              
                              Biomedical waste management is of prodigious impact because biomedical waste can harmfully affect health leading to serious implications to the people who get in touch with it. Segregation, storage and safe disposal of the waste is very crucial to the effective management of biomedical waste in a workplace.
                </p>
              2. Segregation of Biomedical Waste:
              Segregation of waste plays a chief role for enhanced biomedical waste management. It is imperative to decrease the volume of infectious waste or else the quantum of waste will go beyond the control of management. The waste is separated according to various colour coding system of waste containers which is given below:
              
              <li>Red bag: Recyclable contaminated waste such as bottles, intravenous tubes, catheters, urine bags, syringes and gloves.
              </li>              
              <li>Yellow bag: Human and animal anatomical waste, soiled waste including items contaminated with blood, body fluids like dressings, plaster casts, cotton swabs, expired or discarded medicines, chemical waste (liquid), rejected linen, mattresses, beddings infected with blood or body fluid, microbiology, biotechnology and other medical laboratory waste.
              </li>              
              <li>Black bag: Incineration ash and chemical waste (solid).</li>
              <li>White bag: Waste sharps including needles, scalpels, blades, or any other contaminated sharp object that may cause puncture and cuts.
              </li>              
              <li>Blue bag: Metallic body implants and glassware such as medicine vials, ampoules.</li></p>

              <h1>TREATMENT OF BIOMEDICAL WASTE</h1>
              <p><h2>Incineration</h2>

                It is a treatment process used to transform pathological and pharmaceutical waste into ash, flue gases and heat. Functioning temperature for incineration should be in the range of 800-1400 degree Celsius. It reduces the bulk of waste by 90-95% and thus decreases harmful effects on the surroundings.</p>
                <p><h2>Autoclaving

                </h2>

                  It is a method of steam sterilization and is the most common substitute to incineration. Autoclaving necessitates a temperature of 121 degree Celsius and pressure of about 15 pounds per square inch (psi) for 20-30 minutes. This action is applied to inactivate the contagious agents and to sterilize the apparatus used in clinical services. It is less expensive and carries no recognized health impacts.</p>
                  <p><h2>Chemical treatment</h2>

                    This treatment is frequently used to decontaminate liquid waste, so that it can be disposed-off nearby. It makes use of a number of techniques such as oxidation, reduction, precipitation and pH neutralization to transform waste into less dangerous substances. Chlorine, sodium hydroxide or calcium oxide can be used agreeing to the nature of waste.</p>
                    <p><h2>Irradiation</h2>

                      These methods are at present being used in waste treatment procedures which include gamma, electron-beam, ultraviolet and X-rays. Irradiation sterilizes waste in a sealed off chamber by uncovering it to a radioactive cobalt-60 which gives out gamma rays that are lethal to micro-organisms. It is very costly as associated to other methods and protections must be taken to guard workers from detrimental effects of radiations such as cancer, radiation sickness or even death.</p

            <h1>PLASTIC WASTE MANAGEMENT</h1>
            <p><h>Title: Manufacturing of paver blocks using plastic waste</h>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
              The term “Plastics” includes materials composed of various elements such as carbon,
              hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, chlorine and sulfur. plastics are macromolecules, formed by
              polymerization and having the ability to be shaped by application of reasonable amount of
              heat and pressure or another form of forces. Now a days, plastic waste become the major
              cause for different types of pollution, as it is the major constitute of municipal and industrial
              waste in cities even the rural area is producing more waste due to plastic material
              packaging, plastic shopping bags, PET bottles and other goods/appliances using plastic as
              the major component. The world’s annual consumption of plastic materials has increased
              from around 5 million tonnes in the 1950s to nearly 100 million tonnes [1]. The best is to
              use the worst to construct something of routine use. Hence, these waste plastics are to be
              effectively utilized. High-density polyethylene (HDPE) and polyethylene (PE) bags are
              cleaned and added with sand and aggregate at various percentages to obtain high strength
              bricks that possess thermal and sound insulation properties to control pollution and to
              reduce the overall cost of construction, this is one of the best ways to avoid the
              accumulation of plastic waste which is an on-degradable pollutant. Thus, we plan to replace
              the traditional process of paver block manufacture by our eco friendly method of paver
              block manufacture using plastic waste. This is not only economical but is expected to have
              a better strength than the older cement paver block. In this proposed study a very new novel
              approach is presented to reuse the waste plastic materials by converting into the paver
              blocks. To develop an efficient way to effectively utilize the waste plastic as that plastic
              wastes acts as a great threat for sustainment of ecological balance. After formation of blocks
              to evaluate the mechanical and physical properties of paver blocks prepared from waste
              plastics for the desired applications.

            <img src="file:///C:/Users/admin/Downloads/p2.png" alt="types" />
            <p>According to Mehta [2],among primary concrete making materials the emission of carbon
              dioxide is largely attributable to cement production. Cement typically contain an average of
              84% Portland cement clinker, and clinker manufacturing process releases 0.9 tons of carbon
              dioxide par tonne of clinker [3]. Worldwide the concrete industry consumed nearly 2.77 billion
              tonnes of cement in 2007. This translated a sizeable carbon footprint, with global carbon
              dioxide emission rate of 2.07 billion tonnes per year. Current atmospheric concentration of
              carbon dioxide which makes up 85% of greenhouse gases is 390 ppm the highest in recorded
              history and rising exponentially.


              Most cement paving block constructed performed unsatisfactory in the following main areas
              of concern :-


              <li>• Occasional failure due to excessive surface wear .</li>
              <li>• Variability in the strength of the block.</li>
              <li>• Phenomenon of efflorescence due to migration of salt to the surface of porous
              materials.</li>
              <li>• Cement typically contains Portland cement clinker and its manufacturing releases 0.9
              tonne of carbon dioxide per tonne.</li>
              <li>• Exploitation of natural resources in cement production.</li>
              <li>• Cost of production is high.</li>


              Therefore in this proposal an attempt is made to study manufacture the paver blocks using Low
              density polyethylene (LDPE) plastic waste and simultaneously to check the mechanical
              strength of these paver blocks. The LDPE plastic waste is selected due to the following reasons:
              <li>• Has good binding properties thus can bind sand particles.</li>
              <li>• Classified as a thermoplastic in comparison to thermoset hence liquify easily.</li>
              <li>• LDPE is an important industrial material because it is durable , light weight,
              characteristically inert.</li>
              <li>• Melting point for average, commercial LDPE is 105-115 degree Celsius.</li>
              <li>• Density range - 0.910 to.940 gram/cc.</li>
              <li>• It is non-reactive at room temperature.</li>
              <li>• Absorbs almost no water.</li>
              <h2>OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT</h2>
              <p>
                <li>In this proposal an attempt is made to study regard the properties of the paver blocks
                  manufactured by using LDPE plastic wastes</li>
                  <li>To develop an efficient way to effectively utilize the waste plastic as that plastic wastes

                      <li>To replace the conventional plastic waste management techniques with latest ecofriendly scientific techniques.</li>
                      <li>To reduce waste plastic quantities on land and water to avoid land and water pollution. </li>

                      <h3>Steps to transform plastic waste into paving tiles</h3>
                      <p>Step1: Sorting the plastics carefully – This is because different types of plastic melt and burn
                        at different temperatures and have different physical qualities.
                        Step2: Melting until the plastic turn into black liquid – Light a small fire under the metal drum
                        and gently heat it. Add the plastic waste keep adding the plastic gently at the side of the melted
                        plastic until at melts down to a black liquid.
                        Step3: Mining sand into melt – Keep mining thoroughly until all the plastic has metal and there
                        is a constant black liquid. Stirring and heating must continue until all lumps are removed and
                        a homogeneous paste is obtained.
                        Step4: Pouring the mixture into moulds – Prepare the mould by making uses it is very clean,
                        with no pieces of plastic on it. Quickly remove the mixture using the spade with the metal shaft
                        and put into the mould.
                        Step5: Pressing the mixture tightly into moulds - Allow the hot mixture in the mould to set for
                        a few minutes, repeatedly shaking the mould. Keep trying to lift the mould. When the mixture
                        has hardened enough that the slab will not collapse, remove the mould and leave.
                        Step6: Removing the block from the moulds - Tiles made in this way are as strong as concrete
                        pairing tiles. These can be tested and certified as an approved construction product.</p>

                        Mechanical and Physical Testing of Plastic Sand Paver Block
                        • Compressive strength test
                        • Water absorption test
                        • Efflorescence test
                        • Impact test
                        • Abrasion resistance test
                        <h1>EXPECTED OUTCOMES OF THE PROPOSED WORK</h1>
                        <li>This method is suitable for the countries which are facing the problem to dispose and
                          recycle the plastic waste. the natural resources consume for the manufacturing of plastic
                          sand bricks and Paver blocks are very much less and compared to its counterparts. The
                          manufacturing cost can be further reduced by replacing the river sand with fly ash or
                          quarry dust or other wastes products.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            The plastics and bricks will possess more advantages which include cost efficiency
removal of waste products purse abolishing the land requirement problem for dumping
plastic, reduction in the emission of greenhouse gases why conversion of flue gases into
synthetic oil and to protect marine wildlife from deadly plastic pollution.
                          </li>
                          <li>An eco friendly product, which is complete substitute of plastic in all uses, has not been
                            found till date. In absence of suitable alternative it is impractical to impose a blanket
                            ban on use of plastic all over the country rather than to improve the plastic waste
                            management system.</li>
